What is Prometheus?
Prometheus is a powerful assembler emulator writed on Java language.

What it can do?
Prometheus can do everything, from simple code execution to debugging and code optimization by replacing it with a simpler/more efficient one.

Java does not have direct access to memory, how do you writed that tool on this language?
By creating crutches, thereby ditching a little bit of optimization.

Why not C++?
Java is my main programming language, in which I am more or less able to write code.

When will that tool released?
I can't say the exact date, but it won't be soon.

--- Tool task ---
Executing assembler code on java, debugging and code optimization.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////

--- Tool functions ---

* - Runtime code execution
* - Supports almost all instructions (70% of them guaranteed)
* - Debugging (runtime code exeuction interrupt and resuming)
* - Various functions for code replace optimization (remove junk-code, eliminating dead-code, demutation and much more)
* - Code analysis
* - Providing tool own set of instructions that are more efficent for code optimization
* - etc (I haven't figured it out yet)
